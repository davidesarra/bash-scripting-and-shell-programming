#Â Exercise 2
# Modify the script from the previous exercise. Make the "file_count" function
# accept a directory as an argument. Next have the function display the name of
# the directory followed by a colon. Finally, display the number of files to
# the screen on the next line. Call the function three times. First, on the
# "/etc" directory, next on the "/var" directory and finally on the "/usr/bin"
# directory.

    local DIRECTORY=$1
    echo "${DIRECTORY}:"
    ls -1 $DIRECTORY | wc -l
}
