# Exercise 1
# Write a shell script that exit on error and displays commands as they will
# execute, including all expansions and substitutions. Use 3 ls commands in
# your script. Make the first one succeed, the second one fail, and the third
# one succeed. If you are using the proper options, the third ls command will
# not be executed

ls .
ls this-script-does-not-exist.sh
ls . -a
